# Wadjet
Wadjet is a predictive model used to forecast the number of snakebites 
in each department in Colombia as well as the antivenom doses needed 
to cover them, and their cost. It uses an ARIMAX model with rainfall 
data as covariant when possible and a seasonal model when no data is 
available. Wadjet uses data frm the Colombian Instituto Nacional de 
Salud's SIVIGILA program and the Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología 
y Estudios Ambientales of Colombia. The analysis scripts are written in 
R, with a GUI coded in Java using SWT. The project was developed as a 
part of the Introduction to Biomedical Engineering course at Universidad 
de los Andes, 2015-1, with the help of Lucía Pérez Herrera, Camilo Pérez 
Martínez, Luisa Vargas Daza and Sara Nieto Díaz. 

Wadjet is also the Egyptian goddess of snakes and also a sort of oracle
of the future, so we thought it was appropriate.
